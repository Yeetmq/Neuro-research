A transformer is a neural network that learns context and thus meaning by tracking relationships in sequential data like the words in this sentence. A transformer model applies an evolving set of mathematical techniques, called attention or self-attention, to detect subtle ways even distant data elements in a series influence and depend on each other. A transformer is a type of neural network architecture that excels at processing sequential data, most prominently associated with large language models (LLMs). The transformer architecture was first described in the seminal 2017 paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani and others, which is now considered a watershed moment in deep learning. The transformer model is a type of neural network architecture that excels at processing sequential data, most prominently associated with large language models (LLMs). Transformer models have also achieved elite performance in other fields of artificial intelligence (AI), such as computer vision, speech recognition, and time series forecasting. The BERT (or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) encoder-decoder model, introduced by Google in 2019, was a transformer-based model
