A transformer is a neural network that learns context and thus meaning by tracking relationships in sequential data like the words in this sentence. 
Transformer models apply an evolving set of mathematical techniques, called attention or self-attention, to detect subtle ways even distant data elements in a series influence and depend on each other.\nFirst described in a 2017 paper from Google, transformers are among the newest and one of the most powerful classes of models invented to date. They’re driving a wave of advances in machine learning some have dubbed transformer AI. 

Transformers replace convolutional and recurrent neural networks (CNNs and RNNs), the most popular types of deep learning models just five years ago. 
In many cases, users had to train neural networks with large, labeled datasets that were costly and time-consuming to produce. By finding patterns between elements mathematically, transformers eliminate that need, making available the trillions of images and petabytes of text data on the web and in corporate databases.\nIndeed, 70 percent of arXiv papers on AI posted in the last two years mention transformers. That’s a radical shift from a 2017 IEEE

 neural nets are a powerful tool for learning relationships between things, and self-attention is a general way of learning relationships,” said Ashish Vaswani, a former senior staff research scientist at Google Brain who led work on the seminal 2017 paper.\n“Machine translation was a good vehicle to validate self-tention because you needed short- and long-distance relationships among words,’” he added.    in this paper, we describe our transformer and the accuracy records it set for machine translation. 
 we use a basket of techniques to train it in just 3.5 days

 neural networks trained on molecular structure data will be able to learn the relationships between atoms in real-world molecules, which could speed drug discovery. 

In this paper, we present a new framework for the generation of multi-parameter transformers that can be used to power custom chatbots, personal assistants and other AI applications that understand language. 
 the framework is based on the NVIDIA NeMo Megatron model (MT-NLG), which has been trained using hundreds of billions of data elements . 
 it is designed to be used by any business that wants to use its own billion- or trillion-parameters transformers to generate custom chatbot, personal assistant and other artificial intelligence applications that use language.\n

The Switch Transformer (NLG ) was trained using hundreds of billions of data elements, a process that required thousands of GPUs running for weeks. 
 it uses AI sparsity, a complex mixture-of experts (MoE) architecture and other advances to drive performance gains in language processing and up to 7x increases in pre-training speed.\n“Transformer model training can be reduced from weeks to days” said Huang at GTC. 

The transformer model is a type of neural network architecture that excels at processing sequential data, most prominently associated with large language models (LLMs). Transformer models have also achieved elite performance in other fields of artificial intelligence (AI), such as computer vision, speech recognition and time series forecasting.\nThe transformer architecture was first described in the seminal 2017 paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani and others, which is now considered a watershed moment in deep learning. 
Originally introduced as an evolution of the recurrent neural network (RNN)-based sequence-to-sequence models used for machine translation, the

The transformer architecture was first introduced as an evolution of the recurrent neural network (RNN)-based sequence-to-sequence models used for machine translation, transformer-based models have since attained cutting-edge advancements across nearly every machine learning (ML) discipline. 
Despite their versatility, transformer models are still most commonly discussed in the context of natural language processing (NLP) use cases, such as chatbots, text generation, summarization, question answering and sentiment analysis.\nThe BERT (or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) encoder-decoder model, introduced by Google in 2019, was

A transformer model is a neural network capable of performing many computational steps at once, rather than in a serialized manner. Unlike convolutional neural networks (RNNs), this quality of transformers also allows for parallelization: the ability to perform many computations at once. 
 however, the performance of the RNNs and CNNs that had previously been state-of-the-art was significantly improved by the introduction of long short term memory networks (LSTMs), but remains a fundamental shortcoming of modern NLP tasks.\nUnderstanding the mathematical concept of attention, and more specifically self-attention

Transformer models such as relational databases generate query, key and value vectors for each part of a data sequence, and use them to compute attention weights through a series of matrix multiplications. During training, the model makes predictions across millions of examples drawn from its training data, and a loss function quantifies the error of each prediction.\nThrough an iterative cycle of making predictions and then updating model weights through backpropagation and gradient descent, 
 the model “learns” to generate vector embeddings, alignment scores and attention weights that lead to accurate outputs. 

 transformer models implement multi-head attention across multiple attention blocks. Each input token embedding is split into h evenly sized subsets, each piece of the embedding being fed into one of h parallel matrices of Q, K and V weights, each of which are called a query head, key head or value head. The vectors output by each of these parallel triplets of query, key and value heads are then fed into a corresponding subset of the next attention layer, called an attention head. In practice, model training results in each circuit learning different weights that capture a separate aspect of semantic meanings.\nIn some situations,

Transformer models often balance the contextual information provided by the attention mechanism with the original semantic meaning of each token. After the attention-updated subsets of the token embedding have all been concatenated back together before being sent to the next feedforward layer, the updated vector is then added to the token’s original (position-encoded) vector embedding. A residual connection between that layer and an earlier layer of the network might result in an unacceptable loss of information from the original sequence.\nIn some situations, passing along the contextually-updated embedding output by the successive layers of the neural network might

Autoregressive decoder masked language models (MLMs) are designed for text generation, which also extends naturally to adjacent tasks such as summarization and question answering. They’re trained through self-supervised learning, in which the model is provided the first word of a text passage and tasked with iteratively predicting the next word until the end of the sequence. 
Information provided by the self-attention mechanism enables the model to extract context from the input sequence and maintain the coherence and continuity of its output. In training, an MLM is provided a text sample with some tokens masked—hidden—and tasked
